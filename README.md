# Lab09: LINQ in Manhattan

## About Me

*Author: Trevor Stubbs*

----

## Description 
This is a C# console application that will demonstrates the use of LINQ with JSON files.
1. Output all of the neighborhoods in this data list (Final Total: 147 neighborhoods)
1. Filter out all the neighborhoods that do not have any names (Final Total: 143)
1. Remove the duplicates (Final Total: 39 neighborhoods)
1. Rewrite the queries from above and consolidate all into one single query.
1. Rewrite at least one of these questions only using the opposing method (example: Use LINQ Query statements instead of LINQ method calls and vice versa.)
